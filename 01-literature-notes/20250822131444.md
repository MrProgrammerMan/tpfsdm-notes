# Chapter 1: Introduction
The thesis is about _software deployment_, i.e.: getting software from one machine to another.
This is a task that has historically been delegated to system administrators, industry, etc. Many tools have been made that automate manual deployment, but fail to address its fundamental shortcomings.

There exists a ton of evidence that deployment-related issues occur everywhere. The complexity of dependencies make this exceedingly more likely in complex or open-source systems, which are often heavily compartmentalized into components.

The thesis outlines _Nix_, a system for software deployments that fixes many of the fundamental issues plaguing current solutions.
