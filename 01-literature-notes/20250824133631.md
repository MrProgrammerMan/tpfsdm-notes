# Chapter 1.3 Motivation
All the pre-existing solutions to software deployment suffer from one or more of the following:
- Non-validated dependency specifications
- Nominal dependency specifications
- Impossible to deploy multiple versions side-by-side
- Component interference
- Impossible to roll back
- Non-atomic upgrades
- Monolithic applications
- Only admins can deploy
- Disconnect between source and binary artifacts
- No support for both source and binary in a unified way
- Difficult to adapt components
- Component composition is manual
- A specific programming language or framework is required
- Non-portable techniques are required
