# Nix Data Types

---

## üß© Primitive Types

### **Integer**
- Represents whole numbers (e.g., `1`, `-42`, `1000`).
- No decimal points.
- Used for arithmetic and numeric comparisons.

### **Float**
- Represents real numbers with fractional parts (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`).
- Nix floats are less common ‚Äî integers are preferred where possible.
- Floating-point operations can be imprecise due to binary representation.

### **Boolean**
- Logical values: `true` or `false`.
- Used in conditionals (`if` expressions).
- Commonly appears in configuration flags and filters.

### **String**
- Text data, written in double quotes: `"hello world"`.
- Supports interpolation: `"Hello ${name}!"`.
- Can reference paths directly (see **Path** type).
- Multi-line strings can be written using `'' ... ''` syntax.

## üìÅ Path

### **Path**
- Represents a filesystem path, e.g. `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` or `./file.txt`.
- Automatically converted to **store paths** when referenced ‚Äî Nix copies the file into the Nix store.
- Can be relative (`./file.txt`) or absolute (`/nix/store/...`).
- Special because it integrates with the Nix store and ensures reproducibility.

---

## üï≥Ô∏è Null

### **Null**
- Represents the absence of a value.
- Used similarly to `None` in Python or `null` in JSON.
- Useful for optional attributes or configuration fields.
- From a category theory perspective: `null` corresponds to the *one-element set* ‚Äî a neutral placeholder value in pure functional contexts.

---

## üß± Collections of Data

### **Attribute Set**
- Unordered collection of key-value pairs, like a dictionary or map.
- Example: `{ name = "Alice"; age = 30; }`.
- Keys are strings; values can be any type.
- Supports inheritance and merging (`//` operator).
- Fundamental to Nix ‚Äî configurations and derivations are typically attribute sets.

### **List**
- Ordered collection of values, e.g., `[1 2 3]` or `["a" "b" "c"]`.
- Immutable and homogeneous in typical usage (but can hold mixed types).
- Access via list functions (`builtins.elemAt`, `map`, `filter`, etc.).
- Lists are used for sequential data and argument groups.

---

## üßÆ Functions

### **Function**
- First-class and anonymous by default.
- Defined using the syntax:
  ```nix
  x: x + 1
  ```
  or
  ```nix
  { name, age }: "Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}"
  ```
- Functions take one argument (which may be an attribute set).
- No side effects ‚Äî pure and deterministic.

## üß∞ Extra

### **External**
- Represents data managed outside the Nix evaluator, usually provided by plugins or extensions.
- Not typically relevant for general Nix usage or learning.
- Useful mainly for integrating custom evaluation backends or tools.
