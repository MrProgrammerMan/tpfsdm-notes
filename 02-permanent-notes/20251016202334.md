# System

In Nix and NixOS, **system** is a fundamental concept that describes the target operating system and CPU architecture for which a package or configuration is being built. It is often represented as an **attribute** in Nix expressions, allowing conditional logic and cross-platform builds.

## Common Systems

Some of the most common system identifiers used in Nix are:

| System       | Architecture | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| `x86_64-linux` | x86_64      | Standard 64-bit Linux systems |
| `aarch64-linux` | ARM 64-bit  | Common for modern ARM devices, like Raspberry Pi 4 |
| `i686-linux`  | x86 32-bit   | Legacy 32-bit Linux systems |
| `x86_64-darwin` | x86_64     | macOS 64-bit systems |
| `aarch64-darwin` | ARM 64-bit | Apple Silicon (M1/M2) |
| `x86_64-windows` | x86_64    | Windows 64-bit (via cross-compilation) |

## Attribute Use

In Nix expressions, `system` is frequently used as an **attribute** to select appropriate dependencies, binaries, or build logic. Example:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "my-app";
  src = ./src;

  buildInputs = if pkgs.stdenv.isLinux then [ pkgs.gcc ] else [ pkgs.clang ];
}
```
