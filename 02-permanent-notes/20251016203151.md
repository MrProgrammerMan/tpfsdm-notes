# [Flake]([[20251016181621]]) - devShells
One of the standard output attributes of a flake. Takes the following form: `devShells."<system>"."<name>" = derivation;`. You can specify a default devshell: `devShells."<system>".default = derivation;`. Also, see [system]([[20251016202334]]).

- `devShells` are mainly used for local development and testing.
- They can include language runtimes, tools, or scripts needed for your workflow.
- Flake devShells integrate seamlessly with `nix develop` for reproducible environments across machines.

A devShell must be a [derivation]([[20251016165533]]).

## Derivation wrappers
There are some common `derivation` wrappers used when creating a devShell.

### mkShell
`mkShell` is the standard way to create a development environment in Nix. It allows you to declare dependencies and environment variables that are available when you enter the shell via `nix develop`.  

Example:

```nix
devShells.x86_64-linux.default = mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ python39 git ];
  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome to your dev shell!"
  '';
};
```
- `buildInputs` specifies packages that will be available inside the shell.
- `shellHook` is a script that runs whenever you enter the shell.

### mkShellNoCc
`mkShellNoCc` is a variant of `mkShell` which avoids including the default C compiler in the environment. This is useful when you want a minimal environment without extra build tools, or when using cross-compilation setups.
